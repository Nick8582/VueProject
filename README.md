# VueProject

1. The online store "Tehnozavrrr" - a folder called 'magazine' contains a project on the VUE JS framework, the very first project on this framework.
    This project uses:
    :one: Vue v2.7.10 
    :two: Vue-router v3.6.5
    :three: Vuex v3.6.2
    This project is still in the works, the list will be replenished :blush:
